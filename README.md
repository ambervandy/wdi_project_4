##Description
Weekender is any New Yorker's best weekend friend!  The app will find you a new way to explore NYC all at the push of a button.
Once you either decide you want to choose a neighborhood or have the app randomly select a neighborhood, the app will generate
a full weekend day including: a place for brunch, a nearby activity, a cool spot for drinks, and then dinner. Once the day is generated,
the user can click a button and get instant directions to each stop from his or her current location using the Google Maps api with 
waypoints.  Finally, the user can opt to save the day in his or her "days" for later reference, delete a day, or share an activity to 
Facebook.
